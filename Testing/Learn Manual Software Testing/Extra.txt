if any extra feature is there in an application which is not provided in srs, it should be considered as a bug.(sanitation/garbage testing)


smoke testing focuses on the stability of the build
eg: if we buy a phone first we check whether phone is switching on/off or not, network is there or not.(build verification test)

sanity testing focuses on the basic functionalities of the application

bugs found at any of this stage - sanity and smoke are high priority bugs.

release notes contains installation instructions, how to deploy, bug fixes and updates.

anytime we get a bug we dont directly report it to the developer, we cross check it 2-3 times then we checek if there is any environmental issue, if everything is correct from our end then we will report it to dev.
