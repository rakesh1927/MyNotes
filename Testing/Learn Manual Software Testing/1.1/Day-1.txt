A Software is a collection of computer programs that helps us to perform a task.


 Types of Software:
	1) System software
			Ex: Device drivers, Operating Systems, Servers, Utilities, etc.
			
	2) Programming software
			Ex: compilers, debuggers, interpreters, etc.
	
	3) Application software

-----
 Software Testing is a part of software development process.
 Software Testing is an activity to detect and identify the defects in the software.
 The objective of testing is to release quality product to the client. 

 Software Quality
 ---------------------

3 P's

P - People
P - Process
P - Product


Software/Application
	Product (software developed for everyone)
	Project (software developed for a particular group of people)
 
 If software application is developed for multiple customers based on market requirements then it called Product.
 
 If software application is developed for specific customer based on the requirement then it is called Project.

product based (market requirements)
service based (customer requirements)


Error, (dev mistake) 
Bug/defect,  (due to error bug gets raised in application)
Failure (as software is not found with bug while testing, then failure arrises in the customer environment)


Why the software has bugs?
-------
Miscommunication or no communication
Software complexity
Programming errors
Changing requirements
Lack of skilled testers
