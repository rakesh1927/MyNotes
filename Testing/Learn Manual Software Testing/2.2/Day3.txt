Day-3
--------
QA Vs QC  Vs QE

▪ QA is Process related.
▪ QC is the actual testing of the software.
▪ QA focuses on building in quality.
▪ QC focuses on testing for quality.
▪ QA is preventing defects.
▪ QC is detecting defects.
▪ QA is process oriented.
▪ QC is Product oriented.
▪ QA for entire life cycle.
▪ QC for testing part in SDLC

QA is management activity
QC is technical activity

SDET - Software Development Engineering in Test


Testing Methods
-----------
1) White box testing
2) Black box testing
3) Grey box testing


White box testing
-----------
White Box Testing conducts on internal logic of the programs. 
Programming Skills are required.
Ex: Unit Testing & Integration Testing

Black box testing
-----------------
Testing conducts on functionality of the application whether it is working according to customer requirements or not.

Ex: System testing, UAT


Grey box testing
-------
Combination of white box & black box

Ex: Database testing (when we are updating db through frontend it is a type of blackbox but when we are logging in into db and checking whether it is updated or not it is a type of whitebox testing)


Levels of testing
---------
1) Unit testing
2) Integration testing
3) System testing
4) User Acceptance Testing( UAT)

Unit testing/module testing/ component testing
--------------
A unit is a single component or module of a software.
Unit testing conducts on a single program or single module. 
Unit Testing is white box testing technique.
Unit testing is conducted by the developers.

Unit testing techniques:
– Basis path testing (all lines of code should execute atleast once)
– Control structure testing
▪ Conditionalcoverage
▪ Loops Coverage – Mutation Testing

when we do testing in the code level it is known as unit testing, when we do it in ui level it is component testing.


Integration testing
------------------

Integration testing performed between 2 or more modules.
Integration testing focuses on checking data communication between multiple modules.
Integrated Testing is white box testing technique.

▪ Incremental Integration Testing (one module at a time)
		top down
		bottom up
▪ Non- Incremental Integration Testing (all modules at a time)

integration testing when done by devs it is whitebox and when done by testers it is blackbox.

stub is a temporary program, developers will create which will assist in case of any module is not developed so far.

driver is also same as stub, difference is, when temp program is created for bottom up approach(parent is not developed) it is driver and for top down(child is not developed) it is stub.



System testing
--------------
Testing over all functionality of the application with respective client requirements.
It is a black box testing technique.
This testing is conducted by testing team.
After completion of component and integration level testing’s we start System testing.
Before conducting system testing we should know the customer requirements.
System Testing focusses on below aspects.
• User Interface Testing (GUI)
• Functional Testing
• Non-Functional Testing
• Usability Testing

UAT 
------
After completion of system testing UAT team conducts acceptance testing in two levels.

• Alpha testing
• Beta testing
