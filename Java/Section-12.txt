in nested if-else, if one condition matches then other ones dont get executed.

long,double,boolean is not accepted by switch statement.

case canot have condition like "case num>5".

ternary operator can return any datatype. (?:) {both side should be same datatype}

if there is any return statement inside a case block, then no need to provide break.
