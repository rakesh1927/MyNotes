java code -> bytecode -> can be used on any OS (jvm helps with it)

class is a template, with the help of which we can create multiple instances of objects.

methods inside the class can be called with the help of objects of that class

JVM(Java Virtual Machine) runs java bytecode.

JRE(Java Runtime Environment) = JVM + Libraries + other components

JDK(Java Development Kit) = JRE + Compilers + Debuggers

JDK is needed to develop and run java programs, jre is needed to run java programs, all java programs run with the help of jvm.

Application developer -> jdk
Application user -> jre
