for loop has 3 parts:
initialization,condition,operation
all 3 are not mandatory

if is executed only once whereas while is executed multiple times.

if we dont increment value in while loop, then it becomes infinite loop.

do-while, code inside it will executed atleast once.

if you know:
how many times to run -> for
when to end loop -> while
execute atleast once -> do while


//lcm problem
-> max of both numbers
-> check if both are divisble by max
-> if both divisible then max is lcm
-> if not check with next multiple of max

//gcd problem
-> min of both numbers
-> start with min
-> check if both are divisble by min
-> if both divisible then min is gcd
-> if not check with next decrement of gcd
