boolean: Logical value representing either true or false

character: Single character representation

byte: 8-bit integer representation

short: 16-bit integer representation

int: 32-bit integer representation

long: 64-bit integer representation

float: 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number representation

double: 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point number representation
